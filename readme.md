# Voice-Based Personal Assistant

## Overview

This project implements a voice-based personal assistant that allows users to interact with their computer through voice commands. It consists of the following components:

1. **Input Design**: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to input their commands. Users can choose options such as "wish me," "play," or "exit."

2. **Output Design**: After receiving input, the GUI starts listening to the user's voice commands and recognizes them. The assistant then retrieves relevant information from its storage or database and provides accurate output to the user.

3. **Testing**: Testing is conducted to discover errors and ensure the functionality of the system. Various types of testing, including unit testing and integration testing, are performed to validate different aspects of the system.

## Implementation Details

### Input Design

The GUI opens automatically when the code runs, presenting users with options to choose from. Users can interact with the assistant by selecting options such as "wish me," "play," or "exit."

### Output Design

Upon receiving user commands, the assistant listens to the user's voice and recognizes the input. It then retrieves relevant information from its storage or database and displays accurate output to the user.

### Testing

Testing is conducted to validate the functionality of the system. Various types of testing, including unit testing and integration testing, are performed to ensure that the assistant performs accurately and reliably.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy involves conducting technical reviews and testing at different levels of the system. Testing starts with component-level testing and progresses towards testing the full system. Different testing techniques are used at different stages, and debugging is accommodated throughout the testing process.
